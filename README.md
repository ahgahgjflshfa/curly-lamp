## Overview

This repository is a collection of small application implemented in Rust,
inspired by the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) project.

Project are organized by difficulty level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
and cover a variety of problem types.

Each project lives in its own directory with a dedicated README describing the
requirements, how to run it, example output, and possible future improvments.

Use the [Project Index](#project-index) below to quickly explore completed and
in-progress work.

## Scope

This repository focuses on Rust Implementation that can run locally (mostly CLI
tools and small utilities). Some ideas from the original list are intentionally
skipped, especially those that require a full UI or a web fronted.

### Out of scope (for now)

- Projects that primarily require a graphical UI (desktop / mobile).
- Frontend-heavy web apps (HTML / CSS / JS)
